<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>3D printing, also referred to as additive manufacturing (AM), is a family of methods for creating physical objects from virtual representations and digital files of modelled objects or 3D scans. The most common 3D printing techniques extrude a range of materials using heated nozzles, building up objects a layer at a time. Early industrial applications were primarily for rapid prototyping, however as a mature manufacturing technique 3D printing is establishing itself in more markets and sectors <span class="citation"></span>. Projections estimate the 3D printing industry will grow 31% per year until 2020, at which point revenues are expected to exceed $21 billion annually <span class="citation"></span>. Fuelling this growth are a number of additive manufacturing practises, below we have covered the three most popular: Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA) and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS).</p>
<p>Techniques for automated additive manufacturing were developed in the 1960s but were greatly improved by advances in the supporting technical architecture which occurred in the 1980s (including computer-aided design and computerized task management for printers). The first 3D printers used SLA technology, which has had a recent resurgence in small firms and consumer markets. In 2006 the first consumer printer was released by engineering firm Denken. Since then, FlashForge and Autodesk among others, have released SLA printers that fit on a bench and can be supported without highly specialized architectures <span class="citation"></span>. FDM was brought into public eye decisively after decades of development when Makerbot Industries (now subsidiary to Stratasys), released the Thing-o-matic in 2009. Since then there have emerged dozens of companies competing in the FDM consumer markets. Development of SLS printing techniques also began in the 1990’s, but it is generally considered too dangerous to be used outside of specialized industries. Despite this, it is hugely valuable for work processes and manufacturing in specialized areas <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<p>Manufacturing is an integral process for many industry sectors, any changes resulting from the move to AM has the potential to impact a range of markets. Market areas where AM techniques are presently established include aerospace, automotive, health care (medical devices and models), consumer goods, industry applications, as well as research and education. An American consulting firm reporting on additive manufacturing trends identified bioprinting, aerospace, space exploration and tooling as the key emerging markets for 2015 <span class="citation"></span>. In a survey of over 1000 3D printing individuals and organizations based in European countries and United States, the top AM markets were identified as: Consumer Goods, Technology, Industrial Goods, Electronics and Services <span class="citation"></span>.</p>

<h1 id="business-perspective">Business Perspective</h1>
<p>AM provides many opportunities for the reshaping of interactions and relationships between businesses and between businesses and customers. Weller et al. analyzed AM’s economic and technological characteristics as well as economic models to produce a list of qualities that contribute to this reshaping. They indicate AM:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>is a versatile, on-demand manufacturing process</p></li>
<li><p>eliminates sunk-cost customization and flexibility</p></li>
<li><p>allows for design and product line complexity without increasing manufacturing costs</p></li>
<li><p>reduces production steps and manual labour throughout production <span class="citation"></span></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="markets">Markets</h2>
<p>Given how recently the industry became popular, there are not a lot of sources to draw upon when discussing the impact of AM on current markets. Shifts in focus within industries are likely to occur as the technology develops and business models are reshaped. Within the literature, each source categorizes and discusses the sectors and markets affected by AM differently. In some cases a distinction is made between primary secondary markets, where primary means parts produced in-house by machine owners and secondary comprises printed tools, tools made from printed patterns, and parts made from these tools <span class="citation"></span>. This distinction too misses the markets for 3D printers themselves, and fails to differentiate business models that incorporate 3D printing into their business model vs those that offer it as a service to others. Other distinctions include differentiating from sectors using 3D printing for direct part production as opposed to research and development <span class="citation"></span>. Further categorizations depend on the application, region or material used. Unpacking AM’s primary market landscape could help explaining the evolving relationships and interactions between industry stakeholders.</p>
<h3 id="primary-markets">Primary Markets</h3>
<p>Industrial markets, with business (as opposed to consumers) for clients, comprise the majority (93%) of the primary 3D printing markets. Clients are typically large enterprises, generating more business value than secondary markets <span class="citation"></span>. This could imply that as the AM industry grows and evolves, stakeholders operating within primary markets may seek placement in those industrial market segments that offer the highest business value. Being business value-driven, these stakeholders could reshape the industry by repositioning to other market segments, changing their business models to encapsulate 3D printing in their processes or their supply chains.</p>
<h3 id="secondary-markets">Secondary Markets</h3>
<p>Consumer markets are the secondary 3D printing markets and customers consist of small residential consumers and 3D printing hobbyists <span class="citation"></span> as well as industrial designers and boutique/specialized firms. Judging by the composition of this user base, it makes sense that secondary markets have a lower business value when compared to primary markets. However, these markets’ have the majority of 3D printer utilization (79%) <span class="citation"></span>. Contrary to movements in primary markets, secondary markets and their users are likely to be more innovation- and collaboration-driven, possibly creating organizations and systems to aid them in such endeavours. This encourages increased communication between stakeholders in order to propagate technological development in the industry (see Application Perspective, below).</p>
<h3 id="emerging-markets">Emerging Markets</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, 2015 tends for emerging markets include bioprinting (eg. organs), aerospace, space exploration, and tooling <span class="citation"></span>. Most of these markets require further technological advances in order to be developed in significant ways.</p>
<h2 id="business-models">Business Models</h2>
<p>Business models for AM organizations are beginning to be examined in academic literature <span class="citation"></span>. Those initially surveyed are studied for their ability to maximizing value for manufacturers and their customers. From these investigations tools have been established to assist in developing AM-tailored business models, including the “Customer-centric and Value-Based Business Model Framework” <span class="citation"></span>. This framework contains four components surrounding an AM firm in the creation of a business model. These components are: internal factors, customers, risk management, and the macro environment <span class="citation"></span>. Below we have examined some of the more popular business models in depth. All could be applied in various sectors or have components reused in newer forms of business organization, however when concrete industry examples exist they are mentioned.</p>
<h3 id="enabler-for-design-optimization">Enabler for Design Optimization</h3>
<p>One business model emphasizes using AM for design optimization where 3D printing is used to increase manufactured product quality by improving the performance, functionality or aesthetics of the product. This results in a reduction of time required for product development, along with reducing the length of time-to-customer <span class="citation"></span>. Quality optimization and decrease in the product’s development time both add value to the manufacturing process, and increase customer satisfaction. An example of this involves production of lightweight parts for the aerospace industry: Airbus, using Stratasys as their manufacturer (the design optimization enabler), has included over 1000 3D-printed parts into one of their recent Airbus models in order to decrease the airplane’s mass and thereby increase overall performance <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<h3 id="value-add-by-customization">Value Add By Customization</h3>
<p>Similar to design optimization, product customization offers customers the value of reduced manufacturing times and time-to-customer. What makes customization unique is that it enables customers to request one-off, rapidly-prototyped manufacturing for individual, personalized parts <span class="citation"></span>. Research and implementations in the medical industry are notable use cases, involving the production of highly-personalized, tissue-based body part / organ replacements using living cells as ink <span class="citation"></span>. 3D printing organs is still in its infancy, though it illustrates the high degree of personalization that is possible with this type of a business model, in this context, on a patient-by-patient basis.</p>
<h3 id="cost-efficient-production-method">Cost Efficient Production Method</h3>
<p>As its name suggests, this type of model caters to cost efficiency as the key value proposition. Using small-scale / short-run (rapid) manufacturing, customers that require low production volumes of small, yet complex parts are given the opportunity to order affordable printing services, therefore lowering the required manufacturing cost <span class="citation"></span>. Naturally, this caters best to batch-sized orders, though it should be noted that minimal price and cost stability are not guaranteed for all volume sizes, but they can be found, achieved and routinized. Ruffo et al.’s research has detected that there is a point in batch sizing where cost drops significantly and cost stability is reached. Their study examined the AM costs of two small items, rotary knobs and timing belt covers, where a steep cost drop and stability occurred at about 100-item batches <span class="citation"></span>. This of course varies based on the manufactured product itself, however the general idea still remains the same.</p>
<h3 id="new-supply-chain-concepts">New Supply Chain Concepts</h3>
<p>Traditional manufacturing practices require fixed supply chain constructs, whereas AM businesses whose business models incorporate a restructured supply chain provide a more dynamic alternative that contains several value-adding benefits. Fragmented, decentralized production is one of the main features of this 3D printing-oriented model <span class="citation"></span>. Such fragmentation entails leveraging remote production sites in the event that there is a lack of local production tools and limited production factors. This lowers distribution efforts, namely packaging, transportation, and customs expenses, as well as time-to-consumer <span class="citation"></span>. Additionally, the required quantity of safety stocks (spare part supply) can be lowered alongside warehousing costs, as this type of model enables on-demand production <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<p>An example scenario is one regarding the US Navy, who have begun considering the implementation of this model. The proposed idea had been to include 3D printing machinery onboard their aircraft carriers to manufacture parts for UAVs on demand, although this poses security issues within their operational domain <span class="citation"></span>. More widespread applications of the restructured supply chain is possible as well, considering that it could also benefit individual consumers and the manufacturers that supply their machinery. Using a multi-locational, decentralized 3D printing network, a manufacturer (e.g. of a kitchen appliance) would utilize one of its printing centers that is near a customer who requires its services. The local printing center would receive and manufacture the order, and then await customer pickup of the printed product <span class="citation"></span>. As 3D printing technology becomes more affordable, future users of this business model type may also consider sending the order directly to a customer’s home printer, which could further lower operating costs for the manufacturer and decrease waiting time for the customer. However, this would slightly change the definition of a “manufacture”, as home printers become part of the supply chain.</p>
<h3 id="repair-by-am-support-service">Repair by AM / Support Service***</h3>
<p>3D printing can also be applied as a support service for businesses whose machinery requires maintenance through part replacements. Implementation of such a support system would reduce maintenance costs and operational down-times, since any replacement part would be manufactured at the point of demand <span class="citation"></span>. There are known applications of this model type, some of which involve the mobilization of required AM technologies as a means of bringing them closer to the point of demand. For example, Siemens Energy uses SLS to repair their machinery on site <span class="citation"></span>. Support and repair of equipment using 3D printing could be deployed either in b2b contexts or between businesses and consumers. However, full mobilization may not be possible yet for all AM methods due to physical constraints.</p>
<h3 id="emerging-models">Emerging Models</h3>
<p>Development and refinement of AM business models is on the horizon, with 2015 trends impacting 3D printing business models identified by consultants as:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open-source and free resources</p></li>
<li><p>Open-source model repositories gaining traction</p></li>
<li><p>Makerspaces</p></li>
<li><p>3D printing marketplaces and communities</p></li>
<li><p>New categories of AM service providers</p></li>
<li><p>3D scanning and printing in retail</p></li>
<li><p>Established manufacturers and brands entering AM market</p></li>
<li><p>Unique collaborations <span class="citation"></span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Hahn et al. also discuss the correlation between the degree of industry disruptiveness caused and value propositions of start-up firms that implement 3D printing technologies. Further, they note that this could be particularly useful information to external stakeholders, such as potential investors <span class="citation"></span>. In essence, the more disruptive the value proposition, the more lucrative the business could become, if not industry-defining. This may well imply that due to the disruptive nature of 3D printing, key external stakeholders, such as potential investors and customers, can be expected to be highly critical of the ways in which the business offering may disrupt the market. Therefore, their vested interests and expectations could shift more fluidly from one 3D printing organization to another comnpared to organizations providing more traditional manufacturing models.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-perspective">Organizational Perspective</h1>
<h2 id="motivations">Motivations</h2>
<p>A key consideration driving decision-making in consumer-oriented manufacturing sectors is the product life cycle, a concept used to describe a product from introduction to decline. Current market trends are toward a leaner cycle and reduction in product lifespan, forcing companies to innovate with products alongside their business models <span class="citation"></span>. In a McKinsey survey, executives ranked the most important perceived benefits of AM as: “[the ability] to increase geometric complexity [of designs] and reduce time to market, closely followed by reduced tooling and assembly costs” <span class="citation"></span>. Alongside trends toward a leaner product life cycle, three additional areas were determined as important decision points when considering adopting AM:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>lean product life cycle, more responsive to market, design and commercial uncertainties</p></li>
<li><p>product design and delivery, more freedom to explore solutions (e.g. the trend toward mass customization)</p></li>
<li><p>tooling and assembly, particularly in fragmented supply chains</p></li>
<li><p>working capital in inventory, lowering capital tied in inventory increases flexibility and returns on invested capital <span class="citation"></span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All of these motivating factors are driven by the goal to remain competitive within established markets, responding primarily to existing rivalries and threats from substitute products <span class="citation"></span>. However, some of the business models addressed above involved acting as a new entrants, whether established solely for a market or the AM industry versus expanding focus to 3D printing from a related sector.</p>
<h2 id="interactions-and-relationships">Interactions and Relationships</h2>
<p>One key issue addressed by Cohen is the lack of “end-to-end integration across teams,” key strategies to build integration indicate how fully relationships would have to be reshaped <span class="citation"></span>. Potential interventions are: instituting champions for the technology, empowering the product design team through support and education, and creating alignment with procurement, design and production. As well, re-investigating quality assurance (QA) protocols and how the QA team interacts with earlier stages of production is essential, since AM has different testing and validation techniques than traditional manufacturing methods.</p>
<h2 id="business-processes">Business Processes</h2>
<p>Many different organizational scenarios represent a range of possible futures and all include some degree of organizational change for those moving into the sector, already established in manufacturing markets where additive processes could be used, or even for organizational partners, as referenced above.</p>
<h2 id="organizational-roles-and-units">Organizational Roles and Units</h2>
<p>While new technologies always impact administrative and operational structures, AM techniques require rethinking organization design ideologies and processes, potentially impacting many roles and units <span class="citation"></span>. Procurement, tooling, design, production, quality control (testing) as well as project management could all face changes to their work. Further, legal departments and human resources would tackle new regulatory and occupational (including safety) concerns requiring their expertise.</p>
<p>Design for 3D printing requires specialized knowledge of programs and the introduction of workflows for preparing models (see Application Systems below). Those individuals involved with production will see the nature of their work change dramatically when operating 3D printers. Material management, job setup, task management, cleaning and recycling are all new considerations when operating AM systems. Many high-end models may come with leases and repair and maintenance contracts, meaning the printer company representatives will provide that expertise, however smaller organizations may instead bring those roles inside their organization. 3D printers need to be maintained and calibrated on a regular basis.</p>
<h1 id="information-perspective">Information Perspective</h1>
<p>The information perspective in AM centers upon the computer aided design (CAD) packages used to model objects that will be 3D printed. Creating designs is accomplished using any of the number of 3D modeling software packages readily available. Some software allows people to create 3D models from scratch, where other software provides users with basic shapes that can be adjusted to the user’s needs <span class="citation"></span>. Objects may also be 3D scanned using additional software and hardware if someone wishes to replicate it. Regardless of the creation method for a model, there are many considerations before it is ready to be sent to the printer. Given this is a unique situation where digital information is transformed into a material object, there are digital as well as physical concerns to pay attention to <span class="citation"></span>. Primarily, the 3D model being created needs to be precise and unambiguous. If it is lacking in either, the physical object will come out with errors or be impossible to be printed <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="physical-considerations">Physical Considerations</h2>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>What the user is printing needs to be able to fit the printer and the users’ needs. For interlocking objects, size must be given consideration in how they will fit together. Size must also be considering when printing objects that will be worn on the body. <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<h3 id="appendages">Appendages</h3>
<p>If an object contains areas that are vulnerable during the printing process, consideration must be given on how to alleviate the risk of a part breaking off. Users must give thought to the pose of the object, as well as consider adding supports to certain areas. <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>
<p>Some materials are very expensive to print.Depending on what material is being used to create the object, users may want to hollow(er) or thinner what they can in order to save on the material <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="file-considerations">File Considerations</h2>
<h3 id="origin">Origin</h3>
<p>Many organizations will create models to print the objects they wish to manufacture. However, anybody with access to 3D modelling software has the capability to create one. Online communities such as Shapeways allow users to upload their own design to their website and they will print and ship the item to the user.</p>
<h3 id="reliability-trustworthiness">Reliability / Trustworthiness</h3>
<p>The reliability of a model will depend on the source and creator of the model. If it is created within an organization or from an organization than the model will most likely be accurate. If the model is created by an amateur and uploaded somewhere than it may not be as reliable as a 3D printer would like <span class="citation"></span>. Some models from online repositories, such as Thingiverse, may be malformed, and have errors in the meshes that compose their surface, thus making them unsuitable for printing.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-security">Privacy / Security</h3>
<p>The biggest privacy issue with 3D printing currently is that printers do not care what they are printing, they will print any appropriate file they are given. There are no restrictions given to what people are able to print (in the very least, in their home 3D printers) which opens users up to printing potentially counterfeit items or the intellectual properties of others. If an organization is utilizing 3D printers they need to look into ways to keep their files secured and protected. Examples would be encrypting the files, or circulating them through a secure server. There is always the chance in the future that 3D printers will equip digital rights management controls to ensure users are not printing items that are protected <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<h3 id="interoperability">Interoperability</h3>
<p>Applications that are used to view and construct 3D models, scan objects, and manipulate printing configurations work in a variety of formats, each offering different metadata structure. Some programmes will use custom file formats, but often then export to and open stereolithographs– <strong>.stls</strong>, which form a <em>de facto</em> common standard for model files. Similarly, slicers often parse these <strong>.stls</strong> files into a form of open or proprietary <strong>.gcode</strong> format, which the printer reads to print an object with specific characteristics. Other programs, as discussed below, build this conversion into the back end of their software.</p>
<h1 id="application-system-perspective">Application System Perspective</h1>
<h2 id="core-functionalities">Core Functionalities</h2>
<p>Spencer Wright, who writes on design and manufacturing process, describes 3D Printing pragmatically when he writes that “Even when a design has been optimized specifically for the process, it often takes dozens of tries before a functional part comes out of the printer. And the process of troubleshooting a failed build–even at the most advanced …shops in the world–still involves a lot of trial and error,” <span class="citation"></span>. Although models can be acquired that are ready-made for printing, there is, in fact, a more expanded, general process that describes the core functionalities of a 3D printing ‘system’, which can include dimensions of both design and manufacturing. Processes must be optimized not only at the level of model design, but for each printer, and each individual print. Additionally, though beyond the scope of this report, the management of large amounts of information in the form of models, assemblies, and other artefacts of the 3D printing process also poses new opportunities for other types of information management software to develop practises around 3D printing.</p>
<h2 id="d-modelling">3D Modelling</h2>
<p>The design phase of 3D printing is somewhat conceptually separate from the actual manufacturing phase. Depending on their existing design processes, organizations will have various needs when it comes to integrating 3D printing qua manufacturing process. On the whole, however, design, insofar as it includes requirements, engineering standards, and especially modelling, are an essential plane of the 3D printing application layer. There is already an established economy of modelling software, enriched by 3D printing, which has lowered the opportunity cost of one-off manufacturing significantly. Programs like SolidWorks, AutoDesk Fusion (Cloud Integrated) and Blender (FOSS) are parametric modelling programs, which allow users to manipulate the dimensions and extrusions of objects. Other programs (such as Meshmixer) are direct, or explicit modelling programmes, which allow users to sculpt or shape their objects <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="slicing">Slicing</h2>
<p>Slicing is the process of taking a 3D model and preparing it for printing by formatting it as readable for 3D printers. Slicing software takes as metadata settings like the temperature of the nozzles, bed, and chamber of the 3D printers, as well as the desired number of shells and infill percentages for the 3D printed parts. Slicing turns a model into a list of coordinates, either as sintering-layer targets or for sequential visits by FDM nozzles <span class="citation"></span>. These settings will need to be adjusted based on the material and the printer, and can sometimes be found in configuration templates. Slicers also help end users position parts optimally on the bed based on their geometries, and can help them calculate material usage and cost <span class="citation"></span>. Slicers may be more or less open depending on the type of 3D printer or manufacturer.</p>
<h2 id="print-driver-and-firmware">Print-Driver and Firmware</h2>
<p>3D Printing processes generally use one of three general types of architectures to turn solid models into 3D printable G-code <span class="citation"></span>. Print-drivers are applications, that can direct relay information from a computer to a 3D printer, either over Wi-Fi or through a USB connection. Sometimes, the print-driver software is build directly into slicing software. Alternatively, 3D printers may have special firmware enabling them to interpret certain types of files output from slicing programmes into printing motion. These printers can read G-code numerical control language files and print the model contained in those files. There are a wide range of firmwares used by 3D printers <span class="citation"></span>. Cloud-based process have users upload models to cloud-based applications, their parameters specified, and then streamed directly to a 3D printer <span class="citation"></span>. These models attempt to mitigate some of the computational opportunity costs of processing complicated 3D models, though they are still under development.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-3d-printers">Types of 3D Printers</h2>
<h3 id="fused-deposition-modelling-fdm">Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM)</h3>
<p>FDM printing is the most widely known type of 3D printing, and the most accessible to consumers. FDM works by applying successive layers of heated malleable materials in multiple layers to gradually construct an object. FDM printers may use spools of filament that are heated and pushed through an extruder head. Because of their ease of use and low cost, FDM printers currently dominate the consumer market.FDM printing is ideal for printing a variety of conventional and experimental materials, depending on the capabilities of the printer itself. Basic printers often print plastics like PLA or ABS, which are durable and suitable for a wide range of applications. With a heated bed or chamber, printers can also print materials like wood-composite, nylon, polycarbonate, and carbon-fiber reinforced materials..</p>
<h3 id="stereolithography-sla">Stereolithography (SLA)</h3>
<p>SLA printing is perhaps the oldest 3D printing technology, first commercialized in the 1980’s by 3D Systems <span class="citation"></span>. SLA printing operates by using a laser or UV light to cure a photosensitive liquid resin (a prepolymer) into a coherent polymer structure isomorphic to a 3D model <span class="citation"></span>. This is done by exposing a vat of liquid resin, curing it in successive layers. Other similar types of printing, such as polyjet (proprietary to Stratasys), use a deposition head as well as a curing process. SLA has the advantage of being able to print in high resolution, as well as to create complex geometries– giving it excellent potential in the medical and dental modelling fields, as well as an established role in rapid prototyping <span class="citation"></span>. SLA is now also becoming increasingly available to consumers, bringing greater potential for independent designers and smaller businesses, as well as makers <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<h3 id="selective-laser-sintering-sls">Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)</h3>
<p>SLS printing, like SLA, using a high powered laser to harden a uniform material. SLS uses either a reservoir of powdered material or sprays materials ranging from plastic to metal out of a nozzle direction into the path of the laser <span class="citation"></span>, lowering the print bed to melt that material in successive layers. SLS is valuable because it can be used to print very complex parts in a variety of materials, especially strong materials like metal- although not without significant effort. For industries with demand for highly specialized parts in the aerospace and automotive industry, SLS can be used to create small numbers of parts within very specific tolerances <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="evolution-and-future-development">Evolution and Future Development</h2>
<p>3D printing is a rapidly evolving field; costs are dropping and quality is rising. As workflows and software are continually improved, the capacity to print new materials with greater accuracy and lower fail rate will also increase. Advances in materials are already being made by printing incredibly light materials <span class="citation"></span> as well as incredibly complex and tiny structures (known as nano-printing)- and even perhaps living organic material (bio-printing) <span class="citation"></span>. One of the key vectors for advancement will track past advances in material printability. Many of these experimental designs have been built off of consumer platforms, which have, in the last several years, vastly expanded the number of materials they can print- from low temperature thermoplastics like PLA to high temperature ones like nylon and polycarbonate. In the future, it may become easier for smaller firms and even consumers to acquire multi-material printers that can print ceramics or even metal <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advances in 3D printing will be the expansion of job-management applications that enable the coordination of multiple printers simultaneously. Type A machines currently markets the Print Pod- a system of interconnected 3D printers that can handle large assemblies or managed workflows- all of this built on a modified distribution of Octoprint- a FOSS web-based print-driver <span class="citation"></span>. Stratasys too is looking to scale up the use of 3D printers for on-demand manufacturing and to improve the agility of manufacturing workflows <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="open-source-options">Open Source Options</h2>
<p>Likely due in part to its use by makers and designers, there are a great variety of Free and Open Source solutions available in 3D printing. Modelling programs like Blender and OPENSCAD, slicers such as Slic3r and Cura as well as print-drivers and printer firmware are licensed under some version of the GNU GPL license. Some consumer grade FDM printers are also classified as Free Software/Hardware–notably the Aleph Industries Lulzbot TAZ printer <span class="citation"></span>. Companies like Autodesk, developers of the Spark cloud-based 3D printing architecture, often work with their users to refine their products and use open source licences. These products, and 3D printing as-such, has a devoted community of practise where knowledge is created, maintained, and disseminated to new users.</p>
<h1 id="requirements-and-design">Requirements and Design</h1>
<h2 id="modelling-languages">Modelling Languages</h2>
<p>As discussed above, there have been pushes toward standardized metadata schema <span class="citation"></span>. While Interesting, the formats only rehash the metadata that is already encoded into printable files within the .gcode. Storing this data in an organized manner may benefit users, but will be dependant on how models are stored and documented within an organization. UML Class diagrams may help with this process.</p>
<p>There are, furthermore, a number of steps within a 3D printing work-flow that can reliably be expected to arise, including steps like mesh repair, slicing, placement, and setting parameters. While these, in a sense <em>could</em> be reflected by BPMN models, it should be noted that this would obscure a lot of the skilled heuristic work within these subprocesses. Data flow diagrams would offer an interesting, though very distant model of the mediation of data throughout a 3D printing process.</p>
<p>We must at all points, however, recall that there is a large amount of feedback between printer and operator which is obscured by rigorous modelling languages, though they may be useful for training and documentation.</p>
<h2 id="special-challenges">Special Challenges</h2>
<h3 id="throughput">Throughput</h3>
<p>Some objects may take hours or days to create. Organizations need to be aware of this timeliness and consider if the amount of objects they need vs how many printers they can acquire is reasonable in order to adopt 3D printing into their processes. Modelling and print preparation must also be considered as part of this process, and in some cases, where the majority of time is spent.</p>
<h3 id="scalability">Scalability</h3>
<p>Some 3D designs do not scale to traditionally manufacturing. What may work out in a 3d printed prototype may not always scale to manufacturing ideals. Indeed, only specialized and prototypical systems (see Application Systems, above) are capable of cost-effectively competing with traditional manufacturing techniques (i.e. injection moulding) beyond a small number of parts.</p>
<h3 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h3>
<p>Open source 3D printers can be modified to increase nozzle size, to accept more extruder heads, or to print in different materials. In some cases, they can even be rebuilt to print in larger volumes. Both the hardware and software of simple FOSS FDM machines is extremely modular. Proprietary systems do not age as well, and will need to be replaced when their original functionality no longer serves firm needs.</p>
<h3 id="usability">Usability</h3>
<p>Open Source 3D printers and software are powerful, but not always usable out of the box. Operators must be prepared to get to know the mechanics of their software and printers, and to keep the printers maintained and calibrated. Learning to print requires taking on a new mindset to object creation.</p>
<h3 id="interoperability-1">Interoperability</h3>
<p>Referring back to the Information Perspective, having an interoperable hardware and software environment is essential to 3D printing. However, with either proprietary or FOSS equipment, this is generally an easy standard to attain, thanks to widespread use of .stl and .gcode formats.</p>
<h3 id="reliability">Reliability</h3>
<p>Printer reliability is a key concern, as models can fail in many different ways. They may suffer from inter-layer adhesion issues, the printer may not be calibrated correctly, material feed may malfunction, temperature may be off, or slicing may have failed. Troubleshooting these problems and getting 3D printers into a good work-flow is the task of skilled operators, and can only be accomplished with research, technique and time!</p>
<h2 id="recent-advances">Recent Advances</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, progress has been made in improving Throughput and scalability by finding ways to manage multiple printers at a time. Advances in reliability have also been made through an increase in knowledge and the formation of communities of practise, as well as the advance of software.</p>
<h1 id="standards-and-guidelines">Standards and Guidelines</h1>
<h2 id="industry-standards-guidelines-and-best-practices">Industry Standards, Guidelines and Best Practices</h2>
<p>Some perceive the current landscape of additive manufacturing as one with only nascent standards and best practises for everything from technical specifications and file formats to safety <span class="citation"></span>. Further, experts have identified the lack of standards around AM as a key factor when determining barriers to its broad adoption <span class="citation"></span>. However, increasingly efforts are being formed to develop and codify best practises, primarily driven by ASTM International (previously American Society for Testing and Materials) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) <span class="citation"></span>. In 2015 an industry consortium with many of the top printer manufacturers formed to release a 3D printing format specification (3MF) that allows design applications to send full-fidelity 3D models to a mix of other applications, platforms, services and printers <span class="citation"></span>. Also, the Printer Working Group released a White Paper in 2015 identifying the possibilities for “standardization of 3D Printing using the [current] Internet Printing Protocol and PWG Semantic Model” <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<p>ASTM International has a technical committee on Additive Manufacturing Technologies (F42) with working standards on Test Methods (F42.01), Design (F42.04), and Materials and Processes (F42.05) <span class="citation"></span>. ISO established Committee TC 261 for Additive Manufacturing Technologies in 2011, it has four working groups: Terminology (WG1), Methods, Processes and Materials (WG2), Test Methods (WG3), and Data Processing (WG4). UL (Underwriters Laboratories), an American safety consulting organization that is also a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory, has published safety-oriented ``3D Printing &amp; Additive Manufacturing Equipment Compliance [Guidelines]” as well as guidelines for “Medical Equipment Made by 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing” <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<p>Government agencies have been trying to encourage this development of measurements and standards, with NIST recently awarding $7.4 million in grants to research projects working on these challenges <span class="citation"></span>.</p>

<h2 id="regulatory-and-legal-considerations">Regulatory and Legal Considerations</h2>
<p>The fact that 3D printing technology development is not centralized to one country adds a layer of complexity to establishing standards and regulatory consistency <span class="citation"></span>. While the United States hosts many key companies, manufacturers and other organizations vital to the additive manufacturing industry exist across South East Asia and Europe. Already regulated markets face additional hurdles adopting additive manufacturing into their enterprises. Safety-critical sectors including aerospace and health care have to receive approvals from industry regulators in the country they operate in, including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, based on specific criteria that may only be applicable in their areas <span class="citation"></span>. Within certain regulatory agencies, most publicly the FDA, research and strategizing in response to emerging 3D printing trends has led to the beginning of updating and developing new standards that can accommodate <span class="citation"></span>. Recent controversies around the ability for consumers and hobbyists to print guns, another regulated product, led to the Department of Homeland Security issuing a cautionary bulletin in 2013 <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<p>Analysis of patents for 3D printing show a surge from 2010 on, the top 20 companies holding patents reveals a mix of ‘direct entrants’ (Stratasys, 3D Systems Inc., Objet Ltd.), established companies diversifying into the industry (Hewlett-Packard Co, IBM, Xerox), and research institutions (MIT, University of Northwestern). There have been a series of aggressive acquisitions and portfolio consolidation primarily on the part of Stratasys and 3D Systems Inc. Despite this there still exists a distribution across the range of application areas, materials and technologies in patent holders <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property rights for material products are actually comprised of a group of rights including design protection right, copyright, patent and trademark all of which are enforced through law <span class="citation"></span>. Despite harmonization under international efforts including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement these can vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction and other legal restrictions may additionally exist.</p>
<h2 id="associations-and-user-groups">Associations and User Groups</h2>
<p>Various industry, professional and user associations exist for additive manufacturing and 3D printing. Some, including the Additive Manufacturing Association (AMA in the VDMA), Association for Manufacturing Additive Technology Group (AMG) and 3D Printing Association (3DPA), focus on industry members: manufacturers, designers and resellers alongside scientific research organizations <span class="citation"></span> <span class="citation"></span>. There remain those, specifically the Additive Manufacturing Users Group (AMUG), whose mandate expressly orients them toward education and support for users: owners and operators of additive manufacturing equipment <span class="citation"></span>. For consumer equipment, meetups and hackerspaces continue to be popular ways to interact with 3D printers though bespoke events for specific groups and libraries increasingly provide access <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<p>Within the United States there has been significant support from the Federal Government since 2012 within the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI). The flagship Institute for this is America Makes, a national accelerator for additive manufacturing and 3D printing, focusing on “linking and integrating [small- and medium- sized, or startup] companies with existing public, private, or not-for-profit industrial and economic development resources, and business incubators” <span class="citation"></span>.</p>

<p>Our group divided the work based on different sections and each researched and brought together resources before preparing their prospective areas. Dimitar focused on the Business Perspective, Dawn did the Organization Perspective as well as Standards, Lauren did Information Perspective, and Curtis did the Application Perspective. Together from this Curtis and Lauren derived the Requirements Section. Curtis forced everyone to typeset the document on ShareLaTeX, and we all had fun!</p>
