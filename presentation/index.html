						<h2>3D Printing and <br /> Additive Manufacturing (AM)</h2>
						<div align="left">
							<p><br />A family of methods for creating physical objects from virtual representations and digital files of modelled objects or 3D scans.</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Techniques</h3>
						<div align="left">
							<p>Most common 3D printing techniques extrude a range of materials using heated nozzles, building up objects a layer at a time:
								<ul style="font-size:75%">
								  <li>Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM)</li>
									<li>Stereolithography (SLA)</li>
									<li>Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)</li>
								</ul>
						  <p>Early applications primarily rapid prototyping, however matured technique printing is establishing itself in more markets and sectors.</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>History</h3>
						<div align="left">
							<p>Automated AM developed in the 1960s but not until 1980s and advances in computer-aided design and computerized task management that they were greatly improved.</p>

						  <p>First 3D printers used SLA technology. FDM was brought into public eye with release of consumer-oriented Thing-o-matic in 2009. SLS development began in the 1990’s, though it is considered too dangerous to be used outside of specialized industries.</p>

							<p>Denkin released the first consumer printer in 2006. Since then, FlashForge and Autodesk among others, have released SLA printers that fit on a bench and can be supported without highly specialized architectures.</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Industry Landscape</h3>
						<div align="left">
							<p>Manufacturing integral process in many sectors, changes resulting from the move to AM has the potential to impact a range of markets.</p>

						  <p>Market areas where AM techniques are presently established include: aerospace, automotive, health care (medical devices and models), consumer goods, industry applications, as well as research and education.</p>

						<h2>Information Perspective</h2>
						<p> <br/>
							3D Printing is not like the systems discussed previously</p>
						<p>Information perspective focuses on the CAD packages used to create the object to be 3D printed</p>
					</section>

					<section>
					<h2>Physical Considerations</h2>
					<p> Need to keep in mind the physical aspects of the model</p>
					</section>

					<section>
					<h3>Size</h3>
					<p>
					  Object needs to fit the printer and the needs of the user
					  <ul style="font-size: 80%">
					    <li>Size of the printer and what is to be printed</li>
					    <li>For interlocking objects, consider how they fit together</li>
					    <li>Size of the object the model will be used with/on (for example, jewelry)</li>
					  </ul> </p>
					</section>

					<section>
					<h3>Appendages</h3>
					<p>Some areas of a 3D printed object are vulnerable during and after printing. May changehow the model is posed or require additional support for the printing process.</p>
					<p><img align="center" src="img/vulnerableareas.png" width="55%" height="55%" /></p>

					<p align="right" style = "font-size: 40%">(Berenhaus, 2015) </p>
					</section>

					<section>
					<h3>Cost</h3>
					<p>Some materials are very expensive to print with. For some objects, may want to hollow the object or create them thinner to save on material.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
					  <h2>File Considerations</h2>
					  <p> This aspect is more in line with traditional information perspective</p>
					  <p> Takes into account the CAD packages as a whole</p>
					</section>

					<section>
					<h3>Origin</h3>
					<p>Most organizations will create their own models to print. However, anyone with access to 3D modelling software would create one.</p>
					<p>Online communities, such as Shapeways, offer a place for people to upload designs to be printed and shipped.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
					<h3>Reliability &#47; Trustworthiness</h3>
					<p>This aspect will depend on the origin of the model</p>
					<p>
					  <ul style="font-size: 80%">
					    <li> Most likely accurate when created within organization</li>
					    <li>If created by amateur and uploaded, may not be very reliable</li>
					    <li> Uploaded models may be malformed and unsuitable for printing</li>
					  </ul>
					</p>
					</section>

					<section>
					<h3>Privacy &#47; Security</h3>
					<p>3D Printers do not care what they are printing</p>
					<p>Users are able to print whatever they can create</p>
					<p>Organizations should consider encyrption and passing the files through secure servers</p>
					<p align="right" style = "font-size: 40%">

					<section>
					<h3>Interoperability</h3>
					<p>3D modelling applications each offer different metadata structures</p>
					<p align ="left">
					  <ul  style="font-size: 80%">
					    <li>Some use custom file formats</li>
					    <li>stereolithographs - <b>.stls</b> are the common standard</li>
					    <li>.stls often parsed into <b>.gcode</b> format</li>

						<h2>Application System Perspective</h2>
						<blockquote cite="Wright, S. (2015). 3d printing titanium and the bin of broken dreams">
						  &ldquo;Even when a design has been optimized specifically for the process, it often takes dozens of tries before a functional part comes out of the printer. And the process of troubleshooting a failed build–even at the most advanced ... shops in the world–still involves a lot of trial and error.&rdquo;

					<section>
					  <h2>Core Functionalities</h2>
					  <div><p style="font-size:70%">3D printing requires a diverse ecosystem of information, labout, workflows, and applications.  Although models can be acquired that are ready-made for printing, there is, in fact, a more expanded, general process that describes the core functionalities of a 3D printing ‘system’, which can include dimensions of both design and manufacturing. </p></div>

					</section>

					<section>
					  <h2>3D Modelling</h2>
					  <div><p align="justify" style="font-size:60%">
					      Depending on their existing design processes, organizations will have various needs when it comes to integrating 3D printing <i>qua</i> manufacturing process. There is already an established ecosystem of modelling applications that are integratable with a 3D printing workflow. The type of modelling software selected affects not only the software architecture, but the price, capabilities, and the amount of training needed to operate them.
					  </div>

					<div align="centre">
					<p align="justify" style="font-size:75%"> <b>Parametric</b> modelling softwares such as Solidworks, Autodesk Fusion or  Blender (shown above) allow users to create objects by changing dimensions or by extruding faces. Some of these programmes have been mainstays of the modelling craft for years, and have steep learning curves. They are very complex, and allow many parts to be represented in assemblies.</p>

					</section>

					<section>
					  <h2>Slicing</h2>
					  <p align="justify">Slicing is the process of taking a 3D model and preparing it for printing by making it readable for 3D printers (Gcode). Slicers assist users in configuring their models for optimal printing by calculating material usage and cost, as well as configuring attributes such as :</p>
					  <ul>
					    <li>Nozzle, bed and chamber temperature</li>
					    <li>Speed of nozzle movement </li>
					    <li>Number of outer walls (shells) on model</li>
					    <li>Amount of material in model interior (infill)</li>
					    <li>Orientation of model on bed</li>
					    <li>Supports for printing complex geometries</li>
					  </ul>

					  <h3>Printing Processes: Print Drivers and Networking</h3>
					  <div><img src="img/architectures.png" align="center" width="40%" height="40%"/></div>
					  <div>
					    <p align="justify" style="font-size:50%" > Print-drivers are applications, that can direct relay information from a computer to a 3D printer, either over Wi-Fi or through a USB connection. Sometimes, the print-driver software is build directly into slicing software. Alternatively, 3D printers may have special firmware enabling them to interpret certain types of files output from slicing programmes into printing motion. These printers can read G-code numerical control language files and print the model contained in those files. There are a wide range of firmwares used by 3D printers <span style="font-size:75%">[RepRap, 2015]</span>. Cloud-based process have users upload models to cloud-based applications, their parameters specified, and then streamed directly to a 3D printer [Autodesk, 2015, The Printer Working Group, 2015]. These models attempt to mitigate some of the computational opportunity costs of processing complicated 3D models, though they are still under development. </p>

FDM printing is ideal for printing a variety of conventional and experimental materials, depending on the capabilities of the printer itself. Basic printers often print plastics like PLA or ABS, which are durable and suitable for a wide range of applications. With a heated bed or chamber, printers can also print materials like wood-composite, nylon, polycarbonate, and carbon-fiber reinforced materials.

					  <h3>Stereolithography (SLA)</h3>
					  <div align="center" >
					    <img src="img/slagif.gif"/>
					  </div>

					  <div align="center">
					  <p align="justify" style="font-size:65%" >SLA printing is perhaps the oldest 3D printing technology, first commercialized in the 1980’s by 3D Systems [Wohlers and Gornet, 2014]. SLA printing operates by using a laser or UV light to cure a photosensitive liquid resin (a prepolymer) into a coherent polymer structure isomorphic to a 3D model [B&agrave;rtolo, 2011]. This is done by exposing a vat of liquid resin, curing it in successive layers. SLA has the advantage of being able to print in high resolution, as well as to create complex geometries– giving it excellent potential in the medical and dental modelling fields, as well as an established role in rapid prototyping [Cline, 2013]. SLA is now also becoming increasingly available to consumers, bringing greater potential for independent designers and smaller businesses, as well as makers [Anusci, 2015].</p>

					  <h2>Evolution and the Future of 3D Printing</h2>
					  <div style="font-size:50%;width:1000px;overflow:hidden;" >
					    <p> 3D printing is rapidly evolving and barriers to entry are lowering while quality of production is rising. In the last several years, printing has evolved to allow consumers to print with new methods (SLA), in new materials (like Nylon, Rubber, and Wood) and with much greater reliability. </p>
					  <div  align="left" style="width:450px;float:left;display:inline-block">
					  	<ul>
						  <li><b>New Materials</b> will expand the range of applications for 3D printed parts, from Aerospace [Boeing, 2015], to nano-printing [Smith, 2015], and perhaps even organic material (bio-printing) [Organovo, 2015].  </li>
						  <li><b>Job-Management Applications</b> will enable the coordination of multiple printers simultaneously. Type A machines currently markets the Print Pod- a system of interconnected 3D printers that can handle large assemblies or managed workflows- all of this built on a modified distribution of Octoprint- a FOSS web-based print-driver [Type A, 2015]. Stratasys too is looking to scale up the use of 3D printers for on-demand manufacturing and to improve the agility of manufacturing workflows [Crouse, 2015].</li>

					  <h2>Open Source 3D Printing</h2>
					  <div style="font-size:50%">
					    <p>Because of the robust communities of practise including makers, designers, researchers, etc, there many Free and Open Source solutions available for all aspects of a 3D printing workflow. The following applications are all FOSS, released under some permutation of a GNU GPL lisence and are some of the most powerful applications available.</p>
					  <ul>
					  <li> Modelling programs include Blender, OPENSCAD and MESHMIXER.</li>
					  <li>Slicers include Slic3r, Cura, Simplify 3D</li>
					  <li>Some companies like Autodesk often work with their users to refine their products using open source licences.</li>

					<section>
						<h2>Requirements &amp; Design</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
					  <h2>Modelling Languages</h2>
					  <p>There are a number of steps within a 3D printing work-flow that can reliably be expected to arise, including steps like mesh repair, slicing, placement, and setting parameters. While these, in a sense <em>could</em> be reflected by BPMN models, it should be noted that this would obscure a lot of the skilled heuristic work within these subprocesses. Data flow diagrams would offer an interesting, though very distant model of the mediation of data throughout a 3D printing process. We must at all points, however, recall that there is a large amount of feedback between printer and operator which is obscured by rigorous modelling languages, though they may be useful for training and documentation.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
					  <h2>Special Challenges</h2>
					  <img src="img/failing.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" />
					</section>

					<section>
					<h5>Throughput</h5>
					<p style="font-size:60%">Including modelling, prep and print time, and accounting some objects may take hours or days to create. Organizations need to be aware of this timeliness and consider if the amount of objects they need vs how many printers they can acquire is reasonable in order to adopt 3D printing into their processes.
					<h5>Scalability</h5>
					<p style="font-size:60%">Some 3D designs do not scale to traditionally manufacturing. What may work out in a 3d printed prototype may not always scale to manufacturing ideals when geometry and number of parts needed are considered.</p>
					<h5>Extensibility</h5>
					<p style="font-size:60%">Open source 3D printers can be modified to increase nozzle size, to accept more extruder heads, or to print in different materials. In some cases, they can even be rebuilt to print in larger volumes. Both the hardware and software of simple FOSS FDM machines is extremely modular. Proprietary systems do not age as well, and will need to be replaced when their original functionality no longer serves firm needs.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
					  <h5>Usability</h5>
					  <p style="font-size:60%">Printers can take practise to calibrate and may break down. Operators must be prepared to get to know the mechanics of their software and printers, and to keep the printers maintained. Learning to print requires taking on a new mindset to object creation.</p>

					  <h5>Interoperability</h5>
					  <p style="font-size:60%">Having an interoperable hardware and software environment is essential to 3D printing. However, with either proprietary or FOSS equipment, this is generally an easy standard to attain, thanks to widespread use of .stl and .gcode formats</p>

					  <h5>Reliability</h5>
					  <p style="font-size:60%">Models can fail in many ways, from inter-layer adhesion issues, improper calibration, material feed malfunction, temperature being off, or the slicing may have failed. Troubleshooting these problems and getting 3D printers into a good work-flow is the task of skilled operators, and can only be accomplished with research, technique and time!</p>
